<h3>- You, probably</h3>
<p>This, my dear reader, is my very own blog. It's a place I hope to share my learning outcomes and my thoughts, because if one thing's for certain when it comes to the &quot;capital-I&quot; <strong>Internet</strong>, it's that there aren't enough people speaking their minds!</p>
<p>Okay, that's clearly sarcastic; I promise I won't always write so tongue-in-cheek, but I find it necessary to showcase a little personality in a big introductory blog post like this. Despite the vast assortment of mouthpieces and talking heads out there in cyberspace, I wish to add my own voice in the mix. In all honesty, this will just be a journal where I write my thoughts about things I've read, learned, or experienced. No fame or glory desired here.</p>
<h2>Rough start, but I'm still here. What makes your thoughts so important?</h2>
<h3>- Still you, I think</h3>
<p>If it isn't clear from what I've written so far, this is not meant to be some debut to the grand stage of public opinion. If you want to stop reading, you can. Seriously. My word vomit will exist here for no one's pleasure but my own.</p>
<p>My goal is to write a weekly blog post to hold myself accountable and stick to my learning goals. If you know me -- which if you're reading this, frankly, you probably do -- you know that I'm persistent and dedicated <em>to a certain point.</em> After that point, whatever it may be, I lose all interest and move onto the next thing. This attitude served me well growing up because my child-like curiosity coupled with the burning passion that would manifest itself once I was hooked allowed me to explore a great many interests. It's what pushed me down the path of computers and programming, fitness and exercise, and many other things, and for that I'm grateful. The issue now being that I'm an adult...</p>
<p>I don't necessarily have the time to throw myself into new things whenever it so pleases me, nor does that attitude really serve me; with the few free hours of my day I have after getting off of work, it'd be more efficacious for everyone if some of that time was spent exploring a consistent passion. An hour a day dedicated to one thing is great progress at the end of the year, but an hour a day spent on a million different things will show negligible progress, even in a decade.</p>
<h2>Okay. Makes sense so far. But what is it you want to focus on?</h2>
<h3>- You... sure do ask a lot of questions, don't you?</h3>
<p>This is a big deal to say in a public sphere, even if I have no audience, because it makes me feel like I really need to hold myself accountable. If you perused my somewhat-outdated website and checked out my resume, you probably know at least a few things about me:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm a software engineer by trade currently.</li>
<li>I have an unexplained interest in Physics.</li>
<li>I was on my high school robotics team.</li>
</ol>
<p>I mention those three things specifically because they're all related to my one interest: engineering. I'm not just talking software, I'm talking <strong>all of it</strong>. My alma mater is not really known for their rigorous Physics courses or anything like that, but man did I love taking those classes. My time in high school robotics was my first foray into the beauty that is the intersection of the Mechanical, Electrical, and Software Engineering disciplines.</p>
<p>Now, all that to say that I want to put a concerted effort into becoming an <em>amateur physicist</em> and well-rounded engineer. With the startup I'm working on on the side and my full time job, I can't see myself being able to go to back to school anytime soon without sacrificing one of them (both of which I love), so instead here I am, writing a blog, forcing myself to summarize and communicate my weekly learnings. Not only will this help me retain all my gained knowledge, but it can serve as a phantom certification to show others that I have a satisfactory understanding in certain fields.</p>
<p>I will be following <a href="https://www.susanrigetti.com/physics">Susan Rigetti's guide on learning physics</a> and working through <a href="http://Fast.AI">Fast.AI</a>'s course on <a href="https://course.fast.ai">practical deep learning</a> while hopefully saving up some extra dough to slowly assemble my master lab/workshop for engineering projects. On the more hands-on side, I hope to one day be able to contribute to NASA, DARPA, and other similar organizations' challenges, and on the more theoretical side, I hope to be able to understand high level Physics papers and extrapolate useful information; however, the road to that level is long and I've only just begun as far as I'm concerned.</p>
<h2>Well, I'm rooting for you!</h2>
<h3>- Definitely you</h3>
<p>You're too kind! Now, with all that introduction out of the way, I hope this blog successfully entertains and maybe even teaches you a thing or two down the road. This will certainly be a lesson in communication for me.</p>
<p><strong>Have a good one!</strong></p>
<p>Signing off,</p>
<p>Davian</p>
